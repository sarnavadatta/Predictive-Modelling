# Diamond Price Prediction using XGBoost

## Project Overview and Purpose

This project aims to predict the price of diamonds based on their physical characteristics using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. It demonstrates the process of data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization using the popular Diamonds dataset.

## Dataset Description and Source

The project uses the "diamonds" dataset, a built-in dataset within the Seaborn library in Python. This dataset contains information about approximately 54,000 diamonds, including features like carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and price. 

**Source:** Seaborn library (`sns.load_dataset("diamonds")`)


## Methodology and Approach

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** The dataset is loaded using Seaborn, followed by initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data structure, descriptive statistics, and relationships between variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - **Categorical Encoding:** The categorical features (cut, color, clarity) are converted to the Pandas 'category' data type for optimal handling by XGBoost.
    - **Train-Test Split:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
3. **Model Training:** An XGBoost regression model is trained using the training data. The model is initialized with specific hyperparameters, including the objective function and tree method.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess its prediction accuracy.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning and Optimization:** Techniques like early stopping and validation sets are employed to improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

## Code Structure and Usage

The Colab notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Import Libraries:** Necessary libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and XGBoost are imported.
2. **Load and Explore Data:** The diamonds dataset is loaded and explored using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Categorical encoding and train-test splitting are performed.
4. **XGBoost Model Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained, evaluated, and its performance is analyzed using relevant metrics.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The model is further tuned to optimize its performance.

To use the notebook, simply open it in Google Colab and execute the cells sequentially.

## Results and Visualizations

- The trained XGBoost model achieves a low RMSE, indicating its effectiveness in predicting diamond prices.
- Visualizations may include scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to understand the data and relationships between variables.

## Future Work and Improvements

- Explore other feature engineering techniques to potentially improve model accuracy.
