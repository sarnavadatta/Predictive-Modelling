# Customer Classification using XGBoost

## Project Overview and Purpose

This project aims to classify customers into two distinct categories - Horeca (Hotel/Retail/Caf√©) and Retail Channel - based on their purchasing behavior using the XGBoost algorithm. The goal is to build a robust and accurate model that can effectively predict customer segments, enabling targeted marketing and improved customer relationship management.

## Dataset Description and Source

The dataset used in this project is the "Wholesale customers data" available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains information about the annual spending of wholesale distributors on various product categories. 

**Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository

**Features:**

- **FRESH:** annual spending (m.u.) on fresh products (Continuous)
- **MILK:** annual spending (m.u.) on milk products (Continuous)
- **GROCERY:** annual spending (m.u.) on grocery products (Continuous)
- **FROZEN:** annual spending (m.u.) on frozen products (Continuous)
- **DETERGENTS_PAPER:** annual spending (m.u.) on detergents and paper products (Continuous)
- **DELICATESSEN:** annual spending (m.u.) on delicatessen products (Continuous)
- **CHANNEL:** customer channel - Horeca (1) or Retail channel (2) (Categorical)

## Methodology and Approach

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and the 'Channel' variable is converted to binary labels (0 and 1) for classification.
2. **Feature Engineering:** No explicit feature engineering is performed in this project. However, you can explore adding new features or transforming existing ones to potentially improve model performance.
3. **Model Selection:** XGBoost is chosen as the classification algorithm due to its efficiency and proven performance in various classification tasks.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The XGBoost model is trained using the training data and evaluated using the testing data. Performance metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix are used to assess the model's effectiveness.
5. **K-fold Cross Validation:** To ensure model robustness, K-fold cross-validation is performed. This involves splitting the data into k folds and iteratively training and evaluating the model on different combinations of folds, ultimately enhancing model generalization.
6. **Feature Importance Analysis:** The `plot_importance()` function from XGBoost is used to visualize the importance of each feature in the model's predictions. This analysis helps to identify the most influential features in determining customer segments.

## Results and Visualizations

- The model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy score] on the test set.
- The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions.
- The feature importance plot highlights the most influential features in the classification process.

## Future Work and Improvements

- Explore different feature engineering techniques to potentially enhance model performance.
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's settings.
- Consider using other classification algorithms for comparison.
- Deploy the model for real-time customer segmentation.
