# Employee Attrition Prediction

## Project Overview and Purpose

This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various employee attributes and work-related factors, the model identifies potential employees who are likely to leave the company. This information can be used by HR departments to take proactive measures to retain valuable employees and reduce attrition rates.

## Dataset Description and Source

The dataset used for this project is the "HR-Employee-Attrition" dataset, which is publicly available.

**Source:** This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.

**Dataset Features:**

The dataset contains various features about employees, including:

- **Demographic information:** Age, Gender, MaritalStatus, Education, etc.
- **Job-related information:** JobRole, Department, JobLevel, etc.
- **Work-related factors:** MonthlyIncome, YearsAtCompany, WorkLifeBalance, etc.
- **Attrition:** Whether the employee left the company (Yes/No).


## Methodology and Approach

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loading the dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, patterns, and relationships between variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations using one-hot encoding.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection:** Choosing appropriate machine learning models for attrition prediction, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and XGBoost.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Training the selected models on a portion of the data and evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the model parameters to achieve the best possible performance.
7. **Model Deployment:** Deploying the trained model to predict attrition for new employees.

## Code Structure and Usage

The code is organized into several sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** This section includes code for loading the dataset, performing EDA, and preprocessing the data.
2. **Model Training and Evaluation:** This section includes code for training and evaluating different machine learning models.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** This section includes code for tuning the hyperparameters of the selected model.
4. **Model Deployment:** This section includes code for deploying the trained model.

To use the notebook, simply upload it to Google Colab and execute the cells in order.

## Results and Visualizations

The project provides results in the form of evaluation metrics and visualizations, including:

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score for each model.
- **Visualizations:** Count plots, histograms, confusion matrix, and ROC curve to visualize the data and model performance.

## Dependencies and Installation

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:
python !pip install pandas==1.3.5 !pip install numpy==1.21.6 !pip install matplotlib==3.5.3 !pip install seaborn==0.11.2 !pip install scikit-learn==1.0.2 !pip install xgboost==1.6.2

You can install these libraries by running the above commands in a code cell in your Colab notebook.

## Future Work and Improvements
