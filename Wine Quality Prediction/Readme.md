# Wine Quality Prediction

## Project Overview and Purpose

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. Using machine learning techniques, we build a model that can classify wines into different quality categories. This project can be valuable for winemakers and consumers to assess wine quality without relying solely on subjective tasting.

## Dataset Description and Source

The dataset used for this project is the "Wine Quality Dataset" available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains various physicochemical properties of red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

**Dataset Features:**

*   `fixed acidity`
*   `volatile acidity`
*   `citric acid`
*   `residual sugar`
*   `chlorides`
*   `free sulfur dioxide`
*   `total sulfur dioxide`
*   `density`
*   `pH`
*   `sulphates`
*   `alcohol`
*   `quality` (target variable)

## Methodology and Approach

The project follows these key steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Import the dataset, explore its structure, and perform descriptive statistics to understand the data.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize data distributions, identify patterns, and analyze correlations between features.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values (if any) and scale numerical features using StandardScaler.
4.  **Model Selection and Training:** Experiment with different classification models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost.
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score on both training and test sets.
6.  **Visualization of Results:** Create visualizations, such as heatmaps and bar charts, to present the results and insights.

## Code Structure and Usage

The Colab notebook is organized into sections:

1.  **Data Preparation:** Loads and preprocesses the dataset.
2.  **EDA:** Performs exploratory data analysis with visualizations.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** Trains and evaluates various classification models.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Presents the performance metrics of the models.

**To use the notebook:**

1.  Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2.  Execute the code cells sequentially.
3.  Modify parameters or dataset paths as needed.

## Results and Visualizations

The project evaluated four classification models. Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showed the highest accuracy on the test set. The results are visualized through:

*   Correlation heatmap
*   Bar charts showing feature importance
*   Confusion matrix for the best-performing model

## Future Work and Improvements

*   Explore other classification algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Neural Networks.
*   Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
*   Investigate feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.
*   Deploy the model for real-time wine quality prediction.
